# Experiment4 – Node.js Applications

This repository contains all the implementations for **Experiment 4**, which focuses on backend development using Node.js, Express.js, and Redis.

## 📌 Experiment4.1 – CLI Employee Management System

**Aim:**  
To build a command-line employee management system using Node.js with array-based storage.

**Description:**  
This experiment implements a menu-driven CLI application using the `readline` module.  
It allows users to add employees, view employee records, and exit the program.

**Technologies Used:**
- Node.js
- readline module

**Output:**  
The program runs successfully in the terminal and displays menu-based options.

## 📌 Experiment4.2 – RESTful API using Express.js

**Aim:**  
To develop a RESTful API for managing playing card collections using Express.js.

**Description:**  
This experiment demonstrates CRUD operations using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.  
The API is tested using browser/Postman.

**Technologies Used:**
- Node.js
- Express.js

**Output:**  
Server runs successfully on:

## 📌 Experiment4.3 – Ticket Booking System using Redis

**Aim:**  
To create a concurrent ticket booking system with seat locking using Redis.

**Description:**  
This experiment uses Redis (via Memurai on Windows) to implement seat locking and prevent race conditions.  
The backend server handles concurrent booking requests safely.

**Technologies Used:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Redis (Memurai)

**Output:**

## 🌐 Deployment Information

- The **overview page (`index.html`)** is deployed on **Netlify**.
- Backend experiments (4.2 and 4.3) are available in this GitHub repository.
- Experiment 4.3 is not deployed on Netlify as it requires a backend server and Redis.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

All three experiments were implemented successfully and tested.  
This project demonstrates understanding of Node.js fundamentals, REST APIs, and Redis-based concurrency handling.
